Overarching goal, strategy and roadmap
--------------------------------------
The overall outcome of this collaboration is to focus on the WaveScalES simulation work performed in SP3 and make it accessible
as a workflow in a collaborative fashion using tools from SP5 (e.g., Elephant), 6 (e.g., NEST), and 7 (e.g., storage).
See Multi-scale simulations of SWA, SO and AW regimes, with static and plastic synapses (output of SGA1T3.2.5 and T3.2.6)
accessible on https://collab.humanbrainproject.eu/#/collab/11175/nav/83589 for an overview of WP3.2 simulations used as test case.
This workflow is hosted within the Collaboratory, most likely accompanied by one or more joint git repositories hosting the code.
This workflow would include as a first step setting up a "scaffold" or prototype upon which to build:

1. Performing the simulation of a WaveScalES model using DPSNN and NEST on an HBP HPC system (e.g., JULIA) from within the notebook

2. Transformation of the simulation outputs from NEST and DPSNN into a unified and practical Neo data representation

3. Trivial analysis of the data using existing Elephant analysis functions (here it was mentioned: firing rates, spectra, wave direction,...)

4. Visualization of the output in a Jupyter notebook

From this ground work, several directions of work are anticipated:

* Integration of the analysis into concrete comparisons/validations into the validation framework of the HBP (currently developed by SP6 and members at Juelich) This could include two types of validations:
    * models for DPSNN against NEST (i.e., are both engines giving comparable output?)
    * different models developed by SP3 (how do different models/parameters/... differ in the activity they produce?)

    This step would involve work in getting the WaveScalES models into the HBP model catalog

* Use case for the online analysis of a running simulations
    * Currently, work has begun in Juelich to develop systems that enable users to couple simulations running on NEST to online visualization and analysis (in collab. with Simlab Neuroscience).
    * This is an ambitious project, but this workflow may provide good use cases:
        * Perform rudimentary analysis of waves and visualize them online
        * <What else? Something with online visualization of synaptic strengths perhaps?>

* Bring together analysis methods used by both labs for the analysis and characterization of wave-like activity and UP/DN state detection in the Elephant tool
    * Impact: Validated, common analysis tools; exchange of methods and knowledge across labs
    * Further work: Joint development of viewing capabilities of wave activity (e.g., functions to efficient plot waves in the collab, movie like wave plotting)

* Extension of scaffold to the comparison of simulated data vs. experimental data
    * This would be performed formally in a separate collaboration, however, despite new challenges associated with experimental datasets (e.g., register data with the SP5 Knowledgegraph and Neural Activity Resource), there would be very strong syngergies coming from this work.

Repository structure
--------------------

* The submodules *EphysData-Analysis* and *OpticalData-Analysis* contain the code of the orignial analysis pipeline.

* *snakemake_workflow* contains the rewritten Python analysis scripts, a corresponding Python environment, and a workflow description specified with Snakemake_.

    The data on which this analysis is based is stored here_.

Snakemake workflow introduction
-------------------------------

* *scripts* folder: contains all the scripts required by the analysis workflow

* *settings.py* specifies the paths to the required scripts and data sets (needs to be individually adjusted!)

* *configfile.yaml* specifies the tunable parameters of the workflow

* *Snakefile* specifies the individual steps of the workflow in the form of separate rules

**How to run the workflow**

navigate to the snakemake folder

.. code:: bash

    cd snakemake_workflow

Snakemake enables to generate various result files and plots along the steps of workflow by asking for the corresponding output file.
The current options are:

.. code:: bash

    snakemake results/161101_rec01_Spontaneous_RH.nix
    snakemake results/logMUA.nix
    snakemake results/UD_state_vector.npy

When generating the figures, parameters can be passed in the filename such as {channel id}, {t_start}, {t_stop}, and {output format}.
For example:

.. code:: bash

    snakemake results/figures/lfp_traces_t280-304s.png
    snakemake results/figures/power_spectrum.pdf
    snakemake results/figures/logMUA_states_channel2_280-282s.png
